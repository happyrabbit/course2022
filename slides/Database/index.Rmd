# Why?

<p style="font-size:38px;">Becauseâ€¦</p>    

--

- <p style="font-size:28px;">We need data to do the magic</p>   

--

- <p style="font-size:28px;">There are a lot of data and getting data is not always easy</p>  

--

- <p style="font-size:28px;">We spend significant amount of time querying data</p> 

--

<p style="color:blue;font-size:28px;">Start from the building concepts: data warehouse, data pipeline and data modeling</p>

# What is a data warehouse?

> From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database): A database is an organized collection of data.

--

.pull-left[
- It is a database

- Data collected from different sources (internal and external)

- Support further data pipeline, analytics or report
]

# Why data warehouse?

.left-column[
- **Persist data**
- **Data quality**
- **Central view**
- **Model for different data usages**
- **Query performance**
- **Augment source**

# What is a data pipeline?

> [Definition](https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/what-is-a-data-pipeline/): A data pipeline automatically moves data from one or more sources to a target destination.

1. **Entities**: business concepts (sales, product, location, customer etc.)

# Fact table

- Table containing measurements
- All records have the same granularity defined by the business
- Usually additive with timestamps but not always
- Resolve one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(fact_sales), format = 'html')
```

---

# Dimension table

- Table containing business elements
- Fields contain element descriptions
- Referenced by multiple fact tables

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(dim_customer), format = 'html')
```

# SQL 

> SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation. 

- **Query**, insert, update, modify (We only look at the first one)

--

## The SQL world can be overwhelming, but it follows the 20/80 rule...
### We will cover the most used 20%

- Basic: retrieve, filter, sort, aggregate, group

- Intermediate: subquery, join

- Advanced: data types/format, string and date, window function, pivoting data

---

# Basic SQL

.pull-left[

**Retrieve**
- Select `First_Name` and `Last_Name` from table `dim_customer`

```sql
SELECT First_Name, Last_Name 
FROM
dim_customer
```

**Filer**

- Select the first 10 sales records with `Amount > 100`

```sql
SELECT *
FROM fact_sales
WHERE Amount > 100
LIMIT 10
```
]

--

.pull-right[

**Sort**

- Select the top 10 sales records with `Amount > 100`, ordered by `Amount` from high to low

```sql
SELECT *
FROM fact_sales
WHERE Amount > 100
ORDER BY Amount DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Aggregate** and **group**

- Average `Amount` each customer buy (Other aggregate functions: `MAX`, `MIN` , `SUM`, `COUNT`)

```sql
SELECT FK_Customer_ID, AVG(Amount) as Avg_Amount
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY FK_Customer_ID
```
]

---

# Basic SQL recap


---

# Subquery

- **What is it?** query in query

- **When do we need it?** get information from multiple sources

--

Example: name and email of customers who have had an order with `Amount > 100`. The `Amount` information is in table `fact_sales` and the customer information is in table `dim_customer`

```SQL
SELECT PK_Customer_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Email
FROM dim_customer
WHERE PK_Customer_ID IN (
		SELECT customerID
		FROM fact_sales
		WHERE Amount > 100
		);
```

---
# Subquery: best practice and considerations

- There is no limit to the number of subqueries you can have

- Performance slows when you nest too deeply

- Readability deteriorates when you add more
    - This website can [pre-format your SQL code](https://poorsql.com/)
    - An alternative is to use **temporary table** (more later)
    
- Subqueries can be used in several places within a query

--

Example: calculate average amount of purchase per customer

```sql
SELECT total_amount/COUNT(FK_Customer_ID) AS average_per_customer
  FROM (
        SELECT FK_Customer_ID,
               SUM(Amount) AS total_amount,
          FROM fact_sales
          GROUP BY 1
       )
```
---
# Join: The real power of SQL

**Data retrieval from multiple tables in one query**

**Different types of joins**

- `INNER JOIN` selects records that have matching values in both tables
- `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table 
- `RIGHT JOIN` returns all rows from the right table
- `FULL JOIN` returns rows in either table

---
# Data types: the devil that drives you nuts

Three main data types: **string**, **numeric**, and **date/time**

| Data type 	| Stored as (example) 	| Description                                                                                	|
|-----------	|---------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| String    	| VARCHAR(1024)       	| Any characters, with a maximum field length of 1024 characters.                            	|
| Date/Time 	| TIMESTAMP           	| Stores year, month, day, hour, minute and second values as `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`.          	|
| Date/Time 	| DATE                	| A date. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. The supported range is from '`1000-01-01`' to '`9999-12-31`' 	|
| Numeric   	| DOUBLE PRECISION    	| Numerical, with up to 17 significant digits decimal precision.                             	|
| Numeric   	| INT                 	| Allows whole numbers between `-2,147,483,648` and `2,147,483,647`                          	|
