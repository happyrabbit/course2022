# Book

**Books**(Books I personally get back to from time to time in my work. The first four are all hands on with repeatable code. The last one I use when I need to understand the theory):

- [R for Marketing Research and Analytics](http://r-marketing.r-forge.r-project.org/)
- [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) (get the 2nd edition which includes new materials on causal diagram)
- [Applied Predictive Modeling](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/)
- [Introduction to Data Science](http://scientistcafe.com/IDS/) (WIP)
- [Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (A Practical Guide to A/B Testing)](https://www.amazon.com/Trustworthy-Online-Controlled-Experiments-Practical/dp/1108724264)(There is also an online course on it listed below)
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)

**Online courses**

- [Deep learning specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/deep-learning-specialization/) from [deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai/) (other deep learning courses from them are also good. But this specialization is just amazing, clear, comprehensive and hands-on!)
- [A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality)
- [Questionnaire Design for Social Surveys](https://www.coursera.org/learn/questionnaire-design/home/welcome) (Intro course for survey design from U Michigan)
- [Statistical rethinking 2022 course videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN) (I watched the 2019 videos based on the 2nd edition of the book, it is SO good. I plan to watch all 2022 videos too.)
- [A/B testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257) (this course is not just about the technical methods but also the application context)
